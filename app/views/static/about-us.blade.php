<p class="text-center"><strong>Welcome to the Consulting Exchange</strong></p><br />
New Exchange will change the way customers and contractors interact.<br />
No fee requested for registration to the New Exchange marketplace. You pay only the services you actually buy when you close a contract.<br />
Contractors represent the offer of consulting skills and will quote their final rate to their potential clients and their rate will be inclusive of the intermediation fee.<br />
Customers represent the demand for consulting skills and will enter the rate they are prepared to pay. The rate paid by the customers will be inclusive of fees.<br />
New Exchange platform will match buy and sell rates together with the required skills and start the negotiation between the parties.<br />
When a contractor and a customer reach an agreement, they will close their negotiation and start working together, while we continue our intermediation function by handling timesheets, invoices and payments.<br />
New Exchange will collect payments from all clients and pay contractors deducting its fees.<br />
New Exchange will take only a 5% fee on every payment. This means that if a client has agreed with the consultant a rate of $100, the client will pay $100 to New Exchange and the consultant will receive a payment of $95.<br />
In this innovative way, information is completely clear and accessible by the two parties without any filter. Our fees are always the same percentage of the contract values.<br />
We donâ€™t suggest rates or increase our margin under any circumstances.<br />
